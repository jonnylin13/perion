# titan

Named after the first private server I've ever played, `titan` is a library of node modules that helps bring MapleStory private server development to a larger audience.

## Goals

* Implement basic MapleStory functionality including:
  * Cryptography
  * Networking package
  * NPC script manager
  * Event script manager
  * Support multiple maple versions
* Implement modern features:
  * Stateless server system with caching
  * Multi-threaded pool system using `worker_threads`
